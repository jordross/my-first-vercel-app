## Contact Information Placeholders

Contact information is stored as environment variables to make updates easy without touching code. These values appear throughout the website (header, contact section, footer, meta tags).

### Current Placeholders

The site currently uses these placeholder values in `.env.example`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL=info@happybeelandscaping.ca
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_PHONE=(604) 123-4567
```

### How to Update

1. Open or create `.env.local` in the project root
2. Set your actual values:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL=your-actual-email@yourdomain.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_PHONE=(123) 456-7890
   ```
3. Restart the development server or redeploy to production
4. **Important**: Phone numbers should use the format `(###) ###-####` for consistency

### Where These Appear

- **Hero Section**: Primary CTA directs users to contact form
- **Contact Section**: Displayed as clickable links
- **Footer**: Company contact information
- **Meta Tags**: Used in structured data for SEO
- **Form Success Message**: Confirmation displays contact options

### Production Deployment

When deploying to Vercel (or another platform):
1. Add environment variables in the platform's dashboard
2. Do NOT commit `.env.local` to Git (it's already in `.gitignore`)
3. Ensure variables are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side access

### 4. Why Choose Us Section (`/components/WhyUs.tsx`)

**Current Content:**
Highlights four key differentiators:
1. Licensed & Insured
2. Reliable Service
3. Responsive Communication
4. Quality Results

**What You Can Edit:**
- **Benefit Statements**: Ensure these reflect your actual capabilities
- **Proof Points**: Add specific examples where possible:
  - "24-hour emergency response for snow events"
  - "Certified arborists on staff"
  - "5-year warranty on landscaping installations"
- **Number of Benefits**: Add or reduce benefit blocks (keep 3-6 for best visual balance)

**Best Practices:**
- Lead with benefits, not features ("Peace of mind" vs "Insurance coverage")
- Use active language ("We respond" vs "Responses are given")
- Avoid superlatives unless you can back them up ("fastest" → "fast")

---

### 5. Service Area Section (`/components/ServiceArea.tsx`)

**Current Content:**
- Lists Greater Kansas City area with placeholder neighborhoods

**CRITICAL - Update This Immediately:**
This is placeholder content and must be updated to reflect your actual service area.

**What You Can Edit:**

- **Specific Neighborhoods/Zones**: List 4-8 recognizable areas
  - Use neighborhood names property managers will recognize
  - Include surrounding suburbs if applicable
  - Consider listing by ZIP code for SEO benefits
- **Service Radius**: If applicable, mention "and surrounding areas within X miles"

**Example Formats:**
```
Serving Denver Metro Area:
- LoDo and Downtown
- Cherry Creek
- Capitol Hill
- Highlands
- And surrounding areas within 20 miles
```

**Why This Matters:**
Property managers need to know immediately if you serve their properties. Specificity builds trust and improves local SEO.

---

### 6. For Property Managers Section (`/components/ForPropertyManagers.tsx`)

**Current Content:**
Special section addressing property manager-specific needs:
- Bulk pricing
- Seasonal contracts

  - Insurance certificates (COI)

  - "24-hour emergency response"
  - "Same-day quote turnaround"

**Why This Section Matters:**
This is your differentiator for property managers. They have unique needs around contracts, billing, and documentation that residential services don't address.

## SEO & Meta Tags

Meta tags are defined in `/app/layout.tsx` and control how your site appears in search results and social media shares.

### Current Meta Tags

```typescript
title: "Happy Bee Landscaping | Commercial Landscaping Services"
description: "Professional commercial landscaping services for property managers..."
```

### What You Should Update

1. **Title Tag** (50-60 characters recommended):
   - Include primary keyword
   - Include location
   - Include business name
   - Example: "Commercial Landscaping Kansas City | Happy Bee Landscaping"

2. **Meta Description** (150-160 characters):
   - Compelling summary of services
   - Include call-to-action
   - Include location
   - Example: "Professional commercial landscaping for KC property managers. Licensed, insured, reliable. Seasonal contracts available. Get your free quote today."

3. **Open Graph Tags** (for social media):
   - `og:title`: Same as title or slightly longer
   - `og:description`: Same as meta description
   - `og:image`: Add a professional hero image (1200x630px recommended)
   - `og:url`: Your production domain

4. **Keywords to Target** (for content, not meta keywords tag):
   - Commercial landscaping [your city]
   - Property management landscaping
   - [Your city] landscaping services
   - Commercial lawn maintenance
   - Property manager landscaping partner

### Structured Data (Schema.org)

Consider adding LocalBusiness schema to improve search appearance:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Happy Bee Landscaping",
  "description": "Commercial landscaping services",
  "telephone": "(604) 123-4567",
  "email": "info@happybeelandscaping.ca",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "addressLocality": "Kansas City",
    "addressRegion": "MO"
  }
}
```

This can be added to `/app/layout.tsx` in a `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag.

## Brand Voice Guidelines

### Tone Attributes

**Professional**: This is B2B communication with property managers who make business decisions. Maintain a professional, competent tone.

**Transparent**: No hype, no hidden fees, no asterisks. Say what you mean clearly.

**Practical**: Focus on solving problems, not flowery language. Property managers care about results, not poetry.

**Confident**: You know landscaping. You're good at it. State it clearly without arrogance.

**Approachable**: Professional doesn't mean stiff. Use "we" and "you" to create a partnership feeling.

### Writing Style

**Do:**
- Use active voice: "We respond within 24 hours" (not "Responses are provided")
- Be specific: "Weekly mowing, April-October" (not "Regular maintenance")
- Use short sentences and paragraphs for readability
- Break up text with headers and bullet points
- Write for scan-ability (people skim websites)

**Don't:**
- Use industry jargon without explanation
- Write long paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
- Use ALL CAPS for emphasis
- Overuse exclamation points!!!
- Use "we're the best" language without backing it up

### Example Comparisons

**Too Casual:**
"Hey there! Looking for awesome landscaping? We're totally the best in town! Hit us up for a quote! 😊"

**Too Formal:**
"Happy Bee Landscaping LLC hereby extends an invitation to property management entities to engage our organization for the procurement of horticultural services..."

**Just Right:**
"Happy Bee Landscaping partners with property managers to maintain beautiful, safe commercial properties. We handle the landscaping so you can focus on your tenants. Get a free quote today."

## What NOT to Say

### Fake Credentials
❌ "20+ years of experience" (if you're new)
❌ "Award-winning service" (if you haven't won awards)
❌ "Serving Kansas City since 1998" (if you started in 2025)

**Why:** Property managers verify claims. False statements destroy trust and can be fraud.

### Fake Testimonials
❌ "Best landscaper we've ever worked with! - Sarah M."
❌ Made-up Google reviews
❌ "100+ satisfied clients" (if you're new)

**Why:** Property managers check references. Fake reviews are:
1. Unethical
2. Potentially illegal (FTC violations)
3. Easily discovered
4. Permanent reputation damage

### Unverifiable Superlatives
❌ "The best landscaping company in Kansas City"
❌ "Fastest response times in the industry"
❌ "Highest quality guaranteed"

**Why:** Unless you have third-party verification, these are puffery that sophisticated B2B buyers see through.

### Pressure Tactics
❌ "Limited time offer!"
❌ "Call now before spots fill up!"
❌ "Only 3 slots left this season!"

**Why:** Property managers make decisions based on budgets and contracts, not artificial urgency. This approach reads as unprofessional in B2B context.

### Making Promises You Can't Keep
❌ "24/7 availability" (if you're not actually available 24/7)
❌ "Same-day service guaranteed" (if you can't guarantee it)
❌ "Lowest prices guaranteed" (if you're not actually the cheapest)

**Why:** One broken promise = lost client + bad word of mouth in a small professional community.

## Image Placeholders and Guidelines

Currently, the site uses text-based sections without images. When adding images:

### Recommended Images

1. **Hero Background** (1920x1080px):
   - Professional property with landscaping
   - Well-maintained commercial building
   - Bright, welcoming atmosphere
   - **Avoid**: Stock photos that look too generic

2. **Service Icons** (Already implemented with Font Awesome/Lucide):
   - Keep current icon system or replace with custom SVG icons
   - Maintain consistent icon style

3. **About/Team Photos** (Optional):
   - Your crew in company uniforms
   - Your vehicles with company branding
   - Action shots of work being performed
   - **Avoid**: Stock photos of models pretending to be landscapers

4. **Before/After Gallery** (For future addition):
   - Same angle and lighting for comparison
   - Real projects you've completed
   - Include photo release from property owners

### Image Technical Requirements

- **Format**: WebP for best performance, with JPEG fallback
- **Optimization**: Compress images before uploading (use TinyPNG or similar)
- **Responsive**: Provide multiple sizes for different screen widths
- **Alt Text**: Descriptive text for accessibility and SEO
  - ✅ "Commercial property lawn maintenance service in progress"
  - ❌ "image1.jpg"

### Where to Store Images

Images should be placed in `/public/images/` directory:
```
/public/
  /images/
    hero-background.jpg
    service-lawn-care.jpg
    service-landscaping.jpg
    etc.
```

Reference them in code with: `/images/filename.jpg`

---

## Call-to-Action (CTA) Updates

### Current CTAs

1. **Primary**: "Get a Free Quote" (Hero section)
2. **Secondary**: Contact form submission (Contact section)

### CTA Best Practices

**Make Them Action-Oriented:**
- ✅ "Request Your Quote"
- ✅ "Schedule a Consultation"
- ✅ "Get Your Estimate"
- ❌ "Submit" (too generic)
- ❌ "Learn More" (unclear what happens)

**Create Clear Value:**
- "Get a Free Quote - No Obligation"
- "Request a Quote - Response in 24 Hours"
- "Schedule Your Free Property Assessment"

**Use Contrasting Colors:**
- Current button uses yellow on gray-900 background (good contrast)
- Ensure buttons stand out from surrounding content
- Test on mobile devices for tap-ability (minimum 44x44px)

**Strategic Placement:**
- Hero section (immediate action)
- After benefits section (once value is established)
- End of page (after full information)
- Sticky header (optional, for easy access)

---

## Form Endpoint Options

The contact form can be configured to use three different submission methods:

### Option 1: Formspree (Recommended for Most Users)

**Best For**: Non-technical users, quick setup, no backend needed

**Setup:**
1. Create free account at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Create a new form in the dashboard
3. Copy the form endpoint URL (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/abc123xyz`)
4. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FORM_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id
   ```

**Pros:**
- 5-minute setup
- Spam protection included
- Email notifications automatically configured
- Submission dashboard to view all inquiries
- Free tier: 50 submissions/month
- No coding required

**Cons:**
- Third-party dependency
- Free tier limits
- Formspree branding on notification emails (free tier)

**Pricing:**
- Free: 50 submissions/month
- Basic ($10/mo): 1,000 submissions/month
- More at formspree.io/pricing

---

### Option 2: Resend API

**Best For**: Developers, users who want full control, higher volume

**Setup:**
1. Create account at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Verify your sending domain
3. Generate API key from dashboard
4. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
   ```
5. The API route is already configured in the project

**Pros:**
- Full control over email design
- No third-party branding
- Higher volume (100 emails/day free tier)
- Programmable (can trigger automations)
- Clean, developer-friendly API

**Cons:**
- Requires domain verification (DNS records)
- Requires API route setup (already included in this project)
- Slightly more technical

**Pricing:**
- Free: 100 emails/day, 3,000/month
- Pro ($20/mo): 50,000 emails/month
- More at resend.com/pricing

**Domain Verification:**
You'll need to add DNS records to verify your domain. Resend provides the exact records in their dashboard. This typically takes 15-60 minutes to propagate.

---

### Option 3: Mailto Fallback

**Best For**: Temporary solution, testing, very low volume

**Setup:**
Do nothing. If no endpoint is configured, the form automatically uses `mailto:` protocol.

**How It Works:**
When the user submits the form, their default email client opens with:
- To: Your contact email (from environment variable)
- Subject: "Website Inquiry from [Name]"
- Body: Pre-filled with form data

**Pros:**
- Zero configuration
- No cost
- No third-party service
- Works anywhere

**Cons:**
- Poor user experience (leaves your website)
- Requires user to have email client configured
- No submission tracking
- No spam protection
- Mobile users often have issues
- Professional clients may see it as unprofessional

**Recommended Use:**
- Development/testing only
- Very temporary solution until Formspree/Resend is set up

---

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Formspree | Resend | Mailto |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Setup Time** | 5 minutes | 15-30 minutes | 0 minutes |
| **Technical Skill** | None | Basic | None |
| **Cost (low volume)** | Free | Free | Free |
| **Spam Protection** | Yes | Build your own | No |
| **Submission Tracking** | Yes | Build your own | No |
| **User Experience** | Excellent | Excellent | Poor |
| **Domain Verification** | No | Yes | No |
| **Professional** | Yes | Yes | No |

**Recommendation**: Start with Formspree for immediate launch, migrate to Resend later if you need more control or higher volume.
