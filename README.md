## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- npm 9.0 or higher (or yarn/pnpm equivalent)
- Git for cloning the repository

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd happy-bee-landscaping
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages including Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

### Step 3: Environment Setup
Copy the example environment file and configure your variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your specific values (see Environment Variables section below).

### Step 4: Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables

These variables must be set for the website to display correct contact information:

```bash
# Contact Information (displayed throughout the site)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL=info@happybeelandscaping.ca
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_PHONE=(604) 123-4567
```

**Important**: These variables are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` because they are used in client-side components. They will be embedded in the JavaScript bundle.

### Optional Variables

Choose one form submission method by setting the appropriate variable:

#### Option 1: Formspree (Recommended)
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORM_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id
```

**Setup**: 
1. Create a free account at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Create a new form and copy the endpoint URL
3. Configure email notifications in the Formspree dashboard

**Pros**: Easy setup, spam protection, no backend required, submission tracking

#### Option 2: Resend API
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
```

**Setup**:
1. Create an account at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Generate an API key from the dashboard
3. Verify your sending domain
4. Requires backend API route (included in project)

**Pros**: Full control, no third-party branding, programmable email handling

#### Option 3: Mailto Fallback
If no form endpoint is configured, the form will use the `mailto:` protocol, opening the user's default email client.

**Pros**: Zero configuration, works everywhere
**Cons**: Less user-friendly, no submission tracking, potential spam issues

## Development Commands

### Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Runs the app in development mode with hot-reload at `http://localhost:3000`

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
Creates an optimized production build in the `.next` directory. This command:
- Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
- Optimizes and minifies all assets
- Generates static pages where possible
- Creates a production-ready build

### Start Production Server
```bash
npm run start
```
Serves the production build locally. Run `npm run build` first.

### Lint Code
```bash
npm run lint
```
Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues and potential bugs.

## Deployment to Vercel

Vercel is the recommended deployment platform for Next.js applications.

### Method 1: Deploy via Git Integration (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket**

2. **Connect to Vercel**:
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)

## Customization Guidance

### Updating Contact Information
Contact details are centralized in environment variables. Update `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL=your-email@domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_PHONE=(123) 456-7890
```

### Modifying Content
Content is primarily located in:
- `/app/page.tsx` - Main homepage structure and some content
- `/components/Hero.tsx` - Hero section
- `/components/Services.tsx` - Services listing
- `/components/WhyUs.tsx` - Benefits section
- `/components/ServiceArea.tsx` - Coverage area
- `/components/ForPropertyManagers.tsx` - Property manager section
- `/components/Contact.tsx` - Contact form
- `/components/Footer.tsx` - Footer content

See `CONTENT.md` for detailed content management guidance.

### Styling Changes
The site uses Tailwind CSS for styling:
- **Global Styles**: `/app/globals.css`
- **Tailwind Config**: `tailwind.config.ts` (if you need to extend the theme)
- **Component Styles**: Inline Tailwind classes in component files

### Adding New Sections
1. Create a new component in `/components/`
2. Import it in `/app/page.tsx`
3. Add it to the page structure in the desired order
4. Ensure consistent styling with existing sections

### Changing Colors/Branding
The site uses a yellow/black color scheme (bee theme):
- **Primary Yellow**: `bg-yellow-400`, `text-yellow-400`
- **Primary Black**: `bg-gray-900`, `text-gray-900`
- **Accent**: `bg-gray-100`, `bg-gray-50`

To change the color scheme, update Tailwind classes throughout components or extend the theme in `tailwind.config.ts`.

## Performance Optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
**Issue**: TypeScript errors during build
**Solution**: Run `npm run lint` to identify issues, fix type errors

**Issue**: Missing environment variables
**Solution**: Ensure `.env.local` exists with all required variables

### Development Issues
**Issue**: Changes not reflecting in browser
**Solution**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R), clear Next.js cache (delete `.next` folder)

**Issue**: Port 3000 already in use
**Solution**: Kill the process or use a different port: `PORT=3001 npm run dev`

### Form Submission Issues
**Issue**: Form not submitting
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORM_ENDPOINT` is set correctly

**Issue**: Emails not being received
**Solution**: Check spam folder, verify Formspree/Resend configuration, test email addresses

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- **Weekly**: Monitor form submissions, respond to inquiries
- **Monthly**: Review site analytics, check for broken links
- **Quarterly**: Update dependencies (`npm update`), review content accuracy
- **Yearly**: Renew domain registration, review SEO performance

### Updating Dependencies
```bash
# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Update all packages (use with caution)
npm update

# Update Next.js specifically
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

### Security
- Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities
